A prototype consists of a demo in which all team members participate orally, and of the delivery of a document that expands on the proposal.  This will take about 20 to 30 minutes, with length generally proportional to team size.
In general, you should consider this as a kind of "sales call", in which your team presents your product to a potential client (the prof and the TA), in order to demonstrate your team's capabilities, and in order to solicit from the client their opinions and suggestions, so that you can improve your product's functionality.
For the demo:
You need to show a system that takes as input at least one small image collection or a small number of videos, then pushes them through some algorithmic pipeline, to make some matching decisions to a database that has some population, and finally reaches some decision which it displays as output in some form.  Because this is a prototype, you do not have to show any evaluation yet, but you must discuss your plan for measurement or for user studies.  Each team member will be asked to demonstrate and discuss whatever component for which they are responsible.
For the document:
The document should be longer than the proposal, but it can incorporate portions of it.  It needs to talk about: image or video capture; choice of algorithms and development environments; database population; user interfaces (if any); processing accuracy and speed (especially if real time); proposed evaluation methods; and references.  The document should be submitted via Courseworks, but please bring two printed copies with your team to the prototype, one for the prof and one for the TA, so that we assign a portion of the grade to it.
Grading:
The prototype will be evaluated according to the following criteria: concept and creativity; domain engineering for camera, lighting, objects, or other sources of imagery and videos; originality and stability of design; algorithm depth and robustness; database complexity; intuitiveness and comprehensiveness of user interface (if needed); thoroughness of testing; accuracy and reliability of results; feasibility of evaluation plan and methodology; completeness and readability of writeup, and the potential for improvement in system "goodness" and "effectiveness".
